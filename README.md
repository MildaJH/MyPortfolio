My Portfolio Created during bootcamp

## Description

Portfolio created to showcase my skills of HTML and CSS and examples of my work in the future once I gain more skills and knowledge about Web Development as well as my contact details. Hopefully in the future once it is updated during bootcamp progression it will allow me to showcase my capabilities as well as be visible for potential employers. 
Creatign it gave me opportunity to learn more about git-flex and git-grid and media queries as well as main concepts of HTML and CSS.
